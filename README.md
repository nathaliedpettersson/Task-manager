## TaskManager (work in progress)

- An app with the focus of helping people with ADHD to simply manage their tasks and be able to add/delete them. The goal is also to create some sort of time tracker to help calculate how much time each task is supposed to take, and how many tasks can be done in a day, realistically.

- The user should be able to have a clear Monday - Friday view and easily see all tasks for the current week. 

- Colours and making the app look fun and easy to use is a must as it should be different from a "boring white calendar" that's harder to work with for people with ADHD. 

The app will be coded in Svelte using JavaScript/TypeScript.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
